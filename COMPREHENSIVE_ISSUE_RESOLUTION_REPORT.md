  - Added optimal settings for different document types
  - Implemented proper worker cleanup and memory management

**Technical Improvements**:
```typescript
// Before: Basic OCR with minimal error handling
static async processImage(file: File): Promise<OCRResult>

// After: Robust OCR with comprehensive error handling
static async processImage(file: File, options: OCROptions = {}): Promise<OCRResult>
- File validation (50MB limit, format checking)
- Image enhancement (contrast, brightness adjustment)
- Retry logic (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
- Specific error messages for network, memory, format issues
- Optimal settings for document/handwritten/mixed text
```

### 2. ‚ùå Button/Badge Contrast Issues

**Visual Improvements**:
```css
/* Before: Poor contrast */
button[class*="bg-white"] { background: white; color: white; }

/* After: Proper contrast */
button[class*="bg-white"] { 
  background-color: #3b82f6 !important; 
  color: white !important;
  border: 1px solid #2563eb !important;
}
```

### 3. ‚ùå White Container Background Clashes
