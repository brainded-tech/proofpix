## 🚀 Netlify Deployment Steps

### 1. **Prepare Your Repository**
```bash
# Ensure all changes are committed
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for production deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. **Deploy to Netlify**

**Option A: Git Integration (Recommended)**
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and sign up/login
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Connect your GitHub/GitLab repository
4. **Build settings:**
   - **Build command:** `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory:** `build`
   - **Base directory:** (leave empty)

**Option B: Manual Deploy**
1. Run `npm run build` locally
2. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
3. Drag and drop the `build` folder to Netlify

### 3. **Configure Custom Domain (Optional)**
