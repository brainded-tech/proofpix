### ‚ö†Ô∏è Links That Need Verification

3. **Demo/Calendar Links**:
   - `https://calendly.com/proofpix-enterprise` (referenced in Enterprise.tsx)
   - Status: External - needs verification

### üîß Potential Issues Found

1. **Route Redirects**: Multiple pricing routes redirect to main `/pricing`:
   - `/pricing-page` ‚Üí `/pricing`
   - `/document-intelligence-pricing` ‚Üí `/pricing?view=industry`
   - `/enterprise/pricing` ‚Üí `/pricing?view=enterprise`
   - `/legal-pricing` ‚Üí `/pricing?industry=legal`

   - `/solutions/insurance` (referenced in footer)
   - `/solutions/realestate` (referenced in footer)
   - `/about` (referenced in footer)
   - `/privacy` (referenced in footer)
   - `/terms` (referenced in footer)

3. **AI Package Routes**: These routes work but may need verification:
   - `/pricing?package=legal-ai`
   - `/pricing?package=insurance-ai`
   - `/pricing?package=healthcare-ai`
   - `/pricing?package=financial-ai`

## üéØ Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Verify External Links**: Test all external links (blog, GitHub, Calendly)
2. **Create Missing Routes**: Add routes for `/solutions/*`, `/about`, `/privacy`, `/terms`
3. **Update Navigation**: Ensure all footer and navigation links point to existing routes

### Pricing Consistency Achieved:
‚úÖ All enterprise pricing now uses hybrid model
‚úÖ Legal landing page updated to hybrid pricing
‚úÖ AI packages maintain separate pricing structure
‚úÖ OneClick setup uses correct pricing

## üîç Next Steps

1. **Test All Links**: Run automated link checker on the application
