## 🔄 **Rollback Strategy**

### Component-Level Rollback
```typescript
// Feature flag configuration
const featureFlags = {
  interactiveDemo: process.env.ENABLE_INTERACTIVE_DEMO === 'true',
  leadScoring: process.env.ENABLE_LEAD_SCORING === 'true',
  funnelAnalytics: process.env.ENABLE_FUNNEL_ANALYTICS === 'true'
};

// Graceful degradation
if (!featureFlags.interactiveDemo) {
  // Fall back to static demo page
  return <StaticDemoPage />;
}
```

### Rollback Triggers
- Error rate > 5% for 10 minutes
- Page load time > 10 seconds consistently
- Critical functionality broken
- Negative user feedback > 20%

### Rollback Process
1. Disable feature flag for affected component
2. Verify system stability
3. Investigate root cause
4. Implement fix
5. Re-enable with monitoring
